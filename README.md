# GunDrone
A bullet-hell FPS prototype. So much a prototype that most of the enemies are basic shapes and arrows.


* Guns - 4 to be exact, but you can easily make new gun BPs!
* Bullets - Pew, pew! 
* Pickups - Data/EXP, Healing, Energy (for guns), Upgrades (Jumps, health, energy)
* Bouncers - Launch the player in a direction
* Spikes - Ouch
* Energy Shields - Gotta get up close and personal to break them!
* Entities - Characters (walking) and Flyers (flying) with customization behaviors!
* Enemy Component - Slap one of these on anything with collision, and you've got an enemy!
* PrimativeRotatorComponent – Easily rotates any primitive component
* Wave Spawner – Spawn.. Waves of things.
* Pickup Spawner – Configurable and randomized pickup spawns
